# Improvements: in order to not insert the 31s I would have to make several changes
# 1. normalizer.py would need a new version which does the same but does not insert the 31s
# 2. builder.py would need to read the df and load it into a new variable (df_i) in each
# iteration in stead of loading it into the same df variable. This will eliminate the problem
# of the jumping from month to month and day to day. Basically I would not have to use
# the conditionals at the end of every iteration in time frames "a" and "c" to avoid startting
# with an empty df after every iteration.
